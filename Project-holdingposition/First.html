    <h1>BASE HIT SINGLE!</h1>
    <img src="./swing.gif" >
    <p>Not every hit is a home run. Not every swing clears the fences. Sometimes, the most important accomplishments are the ones that barely make it past the infield—singles.
A single may seem small, but it moves the game forward. It creates opportunity, sets the stage for others, and builds momentum. In life, like in baseball, small wins are essential. They are proof that progress is happening, that effort matters, and that every step forward counts.</p>
    <p>Every single is a chance. A chance to advance, to contribute, to feel the rhythm of motion. One single doesnt score a run on its own, but it sets up the possibility of runs later. Likewise, in life, small actions compound. A single word of encouragement, a tiny accomplishment, a quiet decision to try again—these are the hits that carry you closer to your goals.
Dont underestimate the single. Its a symbol of persistence, consistency, and patience. Every journey is built on these small victories, and every single matters.

    </p>
    <p>Base hits remind us that life isnt only about the spectacular moments. Progress is often subtle. Success is built one small hit at a time. Embrace each single, honor the effort, and recognize that even modest achievements move you forward.
Step up. Swing. Make your mark. Every single matters.</p>
